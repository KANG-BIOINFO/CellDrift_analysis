The code for the paper - CellDrift: temporal perturbation effects for single cell data

Perturbation effects on gene programs are commonly investigated in single-cell experiments. Existing models measure perturbation responses independently across time series, disregarding the temporal consistency of specific gene programs. We introduce CellDrift, a generalized linear model based functional data analysis approach to investigate temporal gene patterns in response to perturbations.
